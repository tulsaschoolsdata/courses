They will deepen their writing skills—including grammar, vocabulary, paragraphs, and revision—as they write in the same modes as other students.  The expectation is that the writing of Advanced students will increase in complexity as they near the AP course.

Once their proposal has been approved, students will design an independent research project. Students will be responsible for designing and completing their research. Students will be required to complete a formal write-up of their research and submit that to the Oklahoma Junior Academy of Science for presentation at the annual OJAS meeting. Students may also prepare a poster of their research for presentation at the OJAS meeting or at other professional scientific gatherings.
